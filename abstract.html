							<h3><font size = "3">Yano, M. (2016) Temporal Dynamics of Syntactic and Semantic Prediction, Dissertation.</font></h3>

							<li>　This dissertation reports on a study that examined the temporal dynamics and adaptive nature of syntactic and semantic prediction during Japanese sentence comprehension using event-related brain potentials. Two types of sentences, containing informational conflicts either between semantic and morphosyntactic information or between semantic information, were used. The former type involved argument role-reversal, as in the window closes someone, in which the subject is semantically plausible as a THEME but syntactic information signals it as an AGENT. The latter type involved an aspectually coerced sentence, such as For ten minutes the dog jumped.
							The dissertation provides empirical evidence that structural and aspectual expectation develop as a function of time, even when available information does not change. Structural and aspectual mismatches modulate early effects (i.e. approximately 300–500 ms post-onset), such as left anterior negativity and anterior negativity, only when the time available for predictive computation is sufficient. By contrast, late effects, such as P600 and late anterior negativity are insensitive to the temporal predictability of structural and aspectual information, and may reflect later processes, such as structural and aspectual repair or revision processes. Finally, I discuss the adaptive nature of predictive processing on the basis of the finding that the expectation-related early anterior negativity gradually attenuated in syntactically complex sentences, but no in syntactically simpler sentences.</li>

							<h3><font size = "3" >Yano, M. (to appear) Predictive Processing of Aspectual Information in Japanese: Evidence from event-related brain potentials, Language, Cognition and Neuroscience.</font></h3>
							<li>　We conducted an event-related potential experiment using aspectual coercion to examine whether aspectual information is predictively processed prior to verb input in Japanese. In the experiment, experimental sentences were presented with two presentation durations (500 ms vs. 800 ms) to manipulate the temporal predictability of a verb. Aspectually coerced sentences elicited an early anterior negativity (AN) only when participants had a sufficient time to generate an aspectual prediction for a verb. A late AN was observed in aspectual coercion irrespective of the manipulation of the duration. This result indicates that early AN is elicited by a prediction error pertaining to aspectual information, suggesting that aspectual information is computed predictively based on adverbials without waiting for verb information.</li>

							<p>　Self-paced reading and speeded acceptability judgement experiments on Japanese sentence comprehension were conducted to elucidate the processing mechanisms of ambiguity resolution in structural reanalysis. The results suggest that the parser attempts to maintain an initial clause-mate relationship of noun phrases in the process of reanalysis, which is consistent with the prediction of the Minimal Revision Principle (Frazier and Clifton, 1998), but not with that of the Minimum Maximal-Projection Principle (Oishi, 2007).</p>

							<h3><font size = "3">Yano, M., Suzuki, Y., &amp; Koizumi, M. (2017) The effect of emotional state on the processing of morphosyntactic and semantic reversal anomalies in Japanese: Evidence from event-related brain potentials.</font></h3>
							<p>　The present study examined the locus responsible for the effect of emotional state on sentence processing in healthy native speakers of Japanese, using event-related brain potentials. The participants were induced into a happy, neutral, or sad mood and then subjected to electroencephalogram recording during which emotionally neutral sentences, including grammatical sentences (e.g. window-NOM close vi, ‘The window closes.’), morphosyntactically-violated sentences (e.g. window-ACC close vi, Lit. ‘Close the window.’), and semantically-reversed sentences (e.g. window-NOM close vt, ‘The window closes pro.’) were presented. The results of the ERP experiment demonstrated that while the P600 effect elicited by morphosyntactic violation was not modulated by mood, the P600 effect elicited by semantic reversal anomaly was observed only in participants previously induced into a happy mood. The LAN and N400 were not sensitive to the participants’ tran- sient emotional state. These results suggest intact memory access and impaired integration of syntactic and semantic information in individuals in a sad mood.</p>

							<h3><font size = "3">Yano, M., Yasunaga, D., &amp; Koizumi, M. (2017) Event-related brain indices of gap-filling processing in Kaqchikel.</font></h3>
							<p>　In many languages with flexible word order, transitive sentences in which the subject precedes the object have been reported to have a processing advantage during sentence comprehension compared with those in which the subject follows the object. This observation brings up the question of why this subject-before-object (SO) order should be preferred in sentence comprehension, together with the related empirical question of whether this preference is universal across all human languages. In the present ERP study, we address these two issues by examining the word order preference in Kaqchikel, a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala, in which the verb-object-subject (VOS) order is the syntactically basic word order. In the experiment, native speakers of Kaqchikel were auditorily presented four types of sentences (VOS, VSO, SVO, and OVS), followed by a picture that either matched or mismatched an event described in a preceding sentence, while their EEGs were recorded. The result of the ERP experiment showed that VSO elicited a larger positive component, called a P600 effect, in the comparison to the canonical word order, VOS in the third region (i.e., O of VSO versus S of VOS), in which the filler-gap dependency was supposed to be established in VSO sentences. Furthermore, SVO also exhibited a P600 effect compared to VOS in the third region, reflecting an increased syntactic processing cost. These results indicate that the syntactically basic word order, VOS, requires a lower amount of cognitive resources to process than other possible word orders in Kaqchikel. Based on these results, we argue that the SO preference in sentence comprehension reported in previous studies may not reflect a universal aspect of human languages; rather, processing preference may be language-specific to some extent, reflecting syntactic differences in individual languages.</p>

							<h3><font size = "3">Yano, M. &amp; Sakamoto, T. (2016) The interaction of morphosyntactic and semantic processing in Japanese sentence comprehension: Evidence from event-related brain potentials.</font></h3>
							<p>　The present study examined event-related brain potential (ERP) responses to apparent Case-assignment violations to explore how morphosyntactic and semantic processing interact with each other during Japanese sentence comprehension. Consistent with previous studies on Case-assignment violation, the present results found that a Case-assignment violation elicited a left anterior negativity (LAN), followed by a posterior P600 compared with its grammatical counterpart. Crucially, the LAN-P600 effects were also elicited by a morphosyntactically well-formed sentence with a thematic implausible argument that may potentially force the sentence processor to perceive an apparent Case-assignment violation. Provided that the LAN effects can be interpreted as a morphosyntactic violation effect, these findings suggest that the morphosyntactic and semantic processing streams operate at least partially in parallel during sentence comprehension and that they begin to interact with one another at approximately 400 ms (at the latest) after encountering a verb.</p>

							<h3><font size = "3">Yano, M. &amp; Sakamoto, T. (2016) The functional dissociations between semantic repair and revision processes in Japanese.</font></h3>
							<p>　Since the discovery of the N400 component, the language-related brain responses originally reported by Kutas and Hillyard in 1980, numerous event-related brain potential (ERP) studies on human sentence processing have addressed brain responses elicited by semantic and/or pragmatic incongruity (i.e., semantic repair processes). However, few studies have investigated how an analysis of a sentence fragment is revised when encountering semantically correct but non-preferred  continuation (i.e., the semantic revision processes). The current study investigated semantic revision processes during comprehension of aspectual coercion in Japanese using ERPs. The results showed that sentences involving aspectual coercion increased processing loads and elicited an anterior negativity, which was qualitatively different from posteriorly distributed N400 effects induced by violations of semantic constraints. Anterior negativity is interpreted as the physiological correlate of the semantic revision process, while the N400 reflects the semantic repair process. Based on these findings, the present study suggests that there are (at least) two types of semantic processes in Japanese.</p>

							<h3><font size = "3">Yasunaga, D., Yano, M., Yasugi, Y. &amp; Koizumi, M. (2015) Is the subject-before-object preference universal? An event-related potential study in the Kaqchikel Mayan language.</font></h3>

							<p>　The processing load of sentences with different word orders in the Kaqchikel Mayan language was investigated using event- related potentials. We observed a P600 for subject-verb-object and verb-subject-object sentences as compared to verb-object- subject (VOS) sentences, suggesting that VOS order is easier to process than the other orders. This is consistent with the traditional interpretation in Mayan linguistics that the syntactically determined basic word order is VOS in Kaqchikel, as in many other Mayan languages. More importantly, the results revealed that the preference for subject-object word order in sentence comprehension observed in previous studies may not be universal; rather, processing load in sentence comprehension is greatly affected by the syntactic nature of individual languages.</p>

							<h3><font size = "3">Yano, M. &amp; Sakamoto, T. (2015) An ERP study of causative cleft construction in Japanese: Evidence for the preference of shorter linear distance in sentence comprehension.</font></h3>
							<p>　This study examined the processing of two types of Japanese causative cleft constructions (subject-gap vs. object-gap) by conducting an event-related brain potential experiment to clarify the processing mechanism of long-distance dependencies. The results demonstrated that the subject-gap constructions elicited larger P600 effects than the object- gap constructions. Based on these findings, we argue that the linear distance rather than the structural distance between the extracted argument (filler) and its original gap position is a crucial factor for determining processing costs of gap-filler dependency in Japanese causative cleft constructions. This argument indicates that (at least) some types of long-distance depen- dencies are sensitive to linear distance.</p>

							<h3><font size = "3">Yano, M., Tateyama, Y., &amp; Sakamoto, T. (2014) Processing of Japanese cleft constructions in context: Evidence from event-related brain potential.</font></h3>
							<p>　Numerous studies have found “subject gap preference” in relative clauses and cleft constructions in English, French, and other languages. In contrast, previous studies have reported “object gap preference” in cleft constructions in Japanese. However, the effect of integrating a filler and its gap may be influenced by the effect of transitional probabilities, so previous studies confounded these two factors. This study explores processing asymmetries in Japanese cleft constructions by conducting an event-related brain potential experiment by controlling transitional probabilities. The results demonstrate that the subject gap preference in Japanese is well aligned with that observed in other languages, suggesting that subject gap preference is a universal aspect of language comprehension.</p>
